#Akkorder

Akkorder is a Typescript port of the C++ implementation of the chord recognition algorithm first described in the following conference paper:
"Real-Time Chord Recognition For Live Performance", A. M. Stark and M. D. Plumbley. In Proceedings of the 2009 International Computer Music Conference (ICMC 2009), Montreal, Canada, 16-21 August 2009."
The original implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/adamstark/Chord-Detector-and-Chromagram).
**Note**: This port is not meant to be efficient, i was just in need of a chord detection algorithm that could be used in a browser.
