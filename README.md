# Akkorder

Akkorder is a Typescript port of the C++ implementation of the chord recognition algorithm first described in the conference paper:
* "Real-Time Chord Recognition For Live Performance", A. M. Stark and M. D. Plumbley. In Proceedings of the 2009 International Computer Music Conference (ICMC 2009), Montreal, Canada, 16-21 August 2009."

And expanded upon in Adam Stark's PhD Thesis:

* "Musicians and Machines: Bridging the Semantic Gap in Live Performance", A. M. Stark, PhD Thesis, Queen Mary, University of London, 2011.

The original implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/adamstark/Chord-Detector-and-Chromagram).

**Note**: This port is not meant to be efficient, i was just in need of a chord detection algorithm that could be used in the browser.
